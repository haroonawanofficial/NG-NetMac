## How NetMac Keeps Records

# MAC Address Logging:
- Real-Time Detection: As NetMac monitors the network, it continuously detects and logs every MAC address that appears. This logging includes not just the MAC address itself but also associated data such as the IP address, the first time the MAC was seen, and the last time it was detected.

# Database Storage: 
- All detected MAC addresses and their associated data are stored in a persistent database. This database is maintained across sessions, allowing NetMac to recognize previously seen devices and update their records accordingly.

# New Device Detection:
- When a new MAC address is detected—meaning one that hasn’t been logged before—NetMac logs it as a new device, storing its details and marking the timestamp of when it first appeared.

# Historical Record Maintenance:
- First and Last Seen Timestamps: For each MAC address, NetMac keeps track of when it was first detected and when it was last seen. This helps in understanding the presence and activity patterns of devices on the network over time.

# Change Detection: 
- If a MAC address is detected on different IP addresses or shows unusual behavior (such as frequent IP changes), NetMac logs these changes, providing insights into possible network anomalies or misconfigurations.

## Continuous Monitoring:

# Persistent Monitoring: 
- NetMac operates continuously, meaning it is always actively monitoring the network and updating its logs in real-time. This continuous operation ensures that no activity goes unnoticed, and all relevant data is captured.

# Anomaly Detection:
- With continuous monitoring, NetMac can detect anomalies as they occur. For example, if a device suddenly changes its MAC address or appears on multiple IP addresses in quick succession, NetMac logs these anomalies and can alert the user.

# Data Retention: 
- The persistent database allows NetMac to retain data over long periods, making it possible to analyze trends, review historical activity, and understand the long-term behavior of devices on the network.

## Why Record-Keeping is Important

# Network Security:
- Tracking Unauthorized Devices: By keeping a continuous log of all detected MAC addresses, NetMac helps in identifying unauthorized devices that may attempt to connect to the network. This is crucial for maintaining a secure environment.

# Anomaly Identification:
- The historical data allows for the detection of unusual patterns, such as a MAC address moving between different IPs or appearing on the network at odd times. These anomalies could indicate malicious activity or network misconfigurations that need to be addressed.

## Audit and Compliance:

# Historical Records: 
- Maintaining detailed logs of all network activities is essential for compliance with various security standards and regulations. NetMac comprehensive record-keeping ensures that organizations have access to the necessary data for audits and compliance checks.

# Incident Response: 
- In the event of a security incident, having a detailed log of all network activities, including MAC address movements, can be invaluable for investigating the breach and determining the root cause.
